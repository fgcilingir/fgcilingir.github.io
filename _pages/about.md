Welcome to my website! I am a population/conservation geneticist with a passion for using cutting-edge genomics tools to tackle real-world conservation problems. My research focuses primarily on reptiles, but I also work with mammals and invertebrates. In addition to addressing pressing conservation challenges, my work sheds light on important evolutionary biology questions. I strongly believe in the importance of science communication and enjoy sharing my research with a wide range of audiences. When I'm not in the lab, I love spending time kayaking and rowing, both of which provide a connection to the natural world that inspires my work. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my research and interests.
